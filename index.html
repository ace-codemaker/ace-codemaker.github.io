This could be from developing applications to delivering on more complex projects for your business.","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"Our delivery organisation is made up of highly skilled staff. We have senior project managers that work across all of the different teams to coordinate specialised resources working on a project."},{"value":"item2","text":"When designing new applications, our developers work on small, well-defined units of functionality then move quickly on to the next objective. "},{"value":"item3","text":"When our business starts a new development project, we put a lot of focus on properly defining the software and functional elements that the company will need well in advance of the project start."},{"value":"item4","text":"Our development team has a comprehensive and diverse skill set that meets the full stack of development needs for our business."}]}]},{"name":"page2","elements":[{"type":"checkbox","name":"question10","title":"So many choices, huh? Where to start? Tell us a little about how your company goes about deciding what is important. How do you prioritise which new products and services to develop? How do you go about enhancing existing services already in production?","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"Our business has a very structured approach to delivering on new capabilities. We develop product roadmaps many years in advance, and we deliver against that consistently. As a result, we will typically release new products and services based on core system updates either annually or biannually depending on the size of the release."},{"value":"item2","text":"While our company plans its product releases and code changes, our development teams are always under constant pressure to deliver new features quickly according to our roadmap. There isn't much flexibility in changing the roadmap, and we deliver according to planned quarterly releases and two significant releases software a year."},{"value":"item3","text":"We always do our best to align to a product roadmap. However, we typically end up shipping a combined set of broad features in a single product release."},{"value":"item4","text":"Our dev team is aligned to delivering incremental releases based on iterative changes to the code base. We are very much feature-driven and focused on delivering small enhancements to existing products and services."}]}]},{"name":"page3","elements":[{"type":"checkbox","name":"question3","title":"Communication is king! Please tell us how your dev teams are structured. In your business, how do you collaborate, communicate and assign responsibilities between development teams?","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"In our business, we have a clear management hierarchy. Our managers usually evaluate change requests and own the decision-making process. Individual teams need to seek approval before implementing a project change."},{"value":"item2","text":"Our dev teams are vertically aligned. Each team is responsible for the development of a major component. Our applications are built in several large modules that are assembled and released to production."},{"value":"item3","text":"Our delivery organisation is made up of a group of specialist teams that offer precise capabilities around architecture, design, test management, security and infrastructure design.   Our delivery model follows a waterfall approach. Each team hands off to the next as each part of the project is completed in sequence."},{"value":"item4","text":"Our business takes a holistic approach. We leverage fully integrated dev teams that combine skills as a single group that covers infrastructure, testing, security and development activities.

Tell us about how your business goes about planning and implementing new initiatives, products and services.","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"Our company completes a very detailed planning process before handing off any new work to project management. Once in the hands of our project team, they organise and manage the development team resources. They are then responsible for all collaboration between a broad group of delivery teams."},{"value":"item2","text":"We're really efficient! We operate in agile teams that focus on the delivery of incremental changes and feature sets that we develop and deliver over a few weeks. "},{"value":"item3","text":"As new feature requests come to the dev team, we decide based on resource availability and if we can complete the request in the middle of a delivery cycle. For any new requests that can't be met, we schedule a subsequent release cycle."},{"value":"item4","text":"We deliver new products and enhancements in agile sprints. If we can't include a change request or bug fix at the end of a release, we will attempt to provide a patch. We then look at developing a permanent fix at the start of the next planned release cycle.

Tell us a little about how your teams leverage the technology components that support your development efforts.","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"Out with the old and in with the new! Yes, we do have a lot of legacy in our environment. Many core systems lack supporting documentation and source code control. This lack of documentation makes us very hesitant to make any significant changes due to the associated risk.  "},{"value":"item2","text":"We take a component-based approach to application architecture. Our apps are made up of lots of smaller components that leverage common network services for integration at run-time."},{"value":"item3","text":"We focus on the quality of application development and tend to deliver consolidated updates consistently with all updates ready to push to production in the same release. "},{"value":"item4","text":"We have agile delivery teams that schedule releases of new code to production. Our release schedule manages this. Each new feature is developed in discrete units of functionality aligned to that schedule."}]}]},{"name":"page6","elements":[{"type":"checkbox","name":"question6","title":"Making something new is always exciting, but we also need to maintain it once it's out there. Tell us about your organisation's approach to the deployment of production software and general system maintenance.","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"Our inhouse team has started to develop some basic automation capabilities. Most of which are scripted alerts for significant outages. We also regularly evaluate user reports for any lower-level issues. "},{"value":"item2","text":"Our business puts a lot of effort into observability. We have implemented comprehensive monitoring services across our core environments, and our ops team monitor all alerts. Unfortunately, there are a lot of extraneous alerts that do not need to be actioned, so it consumes a lot of our time. "},{"value":"item3","text":"Most of our processes are manual. When there is a system-level problem, we need to investigate that specific piece of infrastructure manually - we don't have any centralised monitoring or log management capability right now."},{"value":"item4","text":"We have a high degree of automation across our core systems. Patch management occurs according to a life cycle management process, and we get automatic alerts when a fix is needed. However, the patch or fix still needs to be managed manually by operations or support staff."}]}]},{"name":"page7","elements":[{"type":"checkbox","name":"question7","title":"Release Management - so essential, but we don't talk about it enough! Tell us a little about your release management practices and how your dev teams deploy new software into production.","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"We deploy production software in one large drop every six to twelve months. A major release will include many rolled up fixes and functional changes. We also spend a lot of time planning new releases according to our product roadmap."},{"value":"item2","text":"Our development teams leverage agile DevOps practices to include automated build and test management. Still, this automated approach doesn't extend to integration. If there is an issue that we can't rollback from production, we have the authority to make manual changes to the production systems."},{"value":"item3","text":"We try to avoid production changes if possible. Our core systems are so tightly integrated that any change to the code base is risky! We tend to have a major release and then wait for the next upgrade to be available - it seems to be a safer approach!"},{"value":"item4","text":"Our agile DevOps team can accommodate rapid changes in the environment. We often implement new change requests in a matter of weeks (yes we are that good!)."}]}]},{"name":"page8","elements":[{"type":"checkbox","name":"question8","title":"It's all about agility these days!

Tell us about how your company deploys new hardware and the speed at which new capacity can be deployed.","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"Our deployment processes are based on a traditional MAC (Move Add Change) request approach. After a change is requested and approved, our development team must wait for the IT department to provision new infrastructure manually."},{"value":"item2","text":"We have a self-service capability for infrastructure provisioning. New virtual machines can be auto-provisioned in a matter hours or days by our operations team."},{"value":"item3","text":"Our development teams need to tell us what is required - they must prescribe application infrastructure requirements for the operations team to configure and deploy manually."},{"value":"item4","text":"Our operations team takes a hybrid approach to infrastructure provisioning. Some steps are automated, and others need manual intervention. We do have internal service levels that state any request taking longer than a week needs to get reviewed and may not be approved - this can be an obstacle to new development."}]}]},{"name":"page9","elements":[{"type":"checkbox","name":"question9","title":"VM or Bare-metal? Tell us about the way you implement and manage your infrastructure. Do you manage your own servers? Do you have a data centre that is largely virtualised?","isRequired":true,"choices":[{"value":"item1","text":"We maintain our own data centers on-premises or we use co-located hosting facility. We need to manually triage and fix a system outage if a physical server goes down. It happens more than we would like!"},{"value":"item2","text":"Our business has a hybrid infrastructure architecture. We have a large number of manually managed Virtual Machines for production, with a few workloads running in the public cloud."},{"value":"item3","text":"Our business operations would be severely impacted if there was a system outage or datacentre failure. We rely on our infrastructure teams to manually intervene if there is a system failure."},{"value":"item4","text":"Our organisation is starting to modernise our infrastructure architecture. We have already commenced automation of some provisioning tasks, although a lot still need manual intervention. Sometimes it can take several days and many IT resources to deploy a new VM."}]}]}]}
